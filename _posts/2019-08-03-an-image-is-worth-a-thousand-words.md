I've saved hours by updating my MacOS screenshot folder to be a dedicated `~/Screenshots` folder and then mounting the new folder to my dock.

Sort the docked folder by "Date Modified", and then voila, you have an immediate folder to quickly drag and drop your screenshots on to drop in the web browser, chat session, whatever.
