# Always Be Demoing

## End of Cycle Review (a Tutorial)

Aim for a demo in two parts:

### Functional/Behavioral

Show how a human experiences your new feature.

- Intended audience: functional stakeholders (Product Manager, Sales, Customer Support, Customers, etc.) and non-functional stakeholders.
- Show the user interface (UI), the user flows.
- Talk about the obvious parts (user inputs information here, clicks this button), and the non-obvious parts (this is how the system shows errors or throttles the user, etc.).
- Talk about what is _missing_, features/behaviors on the plan that were rejected, and why (time, cost, lack of customer interest, etc.).
- Security, reliability, and scalability should be part of this discussion

### Non-Functional/Mechanical

Show how the system is built, and how it can be measured.

- Intended audience: non-functional stakeholders (Engineers, Operations).
- Review how the feature is implemented, relevant REST endpoints, database schemas, new vendor dependencies, etc.
- Review how the system is tested (at what levels)
- Review what metrics/traces your system emits and how an operator can make decisions about system security and stability.

### Demo vs Review vs Critique

These words are often used interchangably. The purpose of the meeting should be to:

1. Provide a frank demonstration of the current state of the world. Avoid sugar-coating words, or that functionality is "almost done".

### Why include non-functional stakeholders in the functional review?

Non-functional stakeholders can provide good functional feedback. They have built or are building similar systems.

Also, this session will allow them to understand the requirements and user experiences before diving into the internals. An engineer who only looks at code without context will have less empathy for the user and the code author.

## Daily Demo

At the start of each day, think about a "physical" artifact that you can generate.

At the start of a project this might be:

- A fully scoped design document ready for review.
- A
